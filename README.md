# Ready to go Next.js Boilerplate (ULTIMATE)
Ultimate Flavors, this is my personal tool preferences for writing medium to huge Next.js app, many of the features included here might be doesn't suit your usecase or might be overkill. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
## Ultimate additions (aside from the basics)
- Redux toolkit + Next Redux Wrapper integration
- Using preact instead of react bundle (next-plugin-preact)
- Global page loader using nprogress
- Enable bundle analyzer
